                <p>
                    My name is <mark>Luther Bell</mark> and I am senior at St. John's University. I have been attending St. John's for four years now and I am looking forward to graduating this May and moving on to the next chapter in my life.
                    I live in Maryland and went to high school in Maryland. My major is <mark>computer science</mark> with a concentration in <mark>cyber security</mark>. Although, I enjoy Cyber Security, sometimes I wish I would have chosen a different concentration instead.
                    The only reason I chose cyber is because I originally came in as only a cyber security major because I knew there were an endless amount of job opprotunities and I always had an interest in computers. It wasn't until I took a couple of     
                    cyber security classes that I realized this was not the major for me. While taking cyber classes I also took programming classes and I was pretty good at it and I had fun doing it, which was suprising for me. I realized with programming I could create a ton of things
                    and let my creativity flow, and that is why I chose computer science as my major.
